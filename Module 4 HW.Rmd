## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

QUESTION: Suppose that for certain microRNA of size 20 the probability of a purine is 
binomially distributed with probability 0.7. Say there are 100 such microRNAs, 
each independent of the other.  
 
Let Y denote the average number of purine in these microRNAs. Find the 
probability that Y is great than 15. Please give a theoretical calculation, do NOT 
use Monte Carlo simulation to approximate. Show all the steps and formulas in 
your calculation. 

Use a binomial distribution and central limit theorem 

```{r}
n = 20
p = 0.7
m = n * p 
v = n * p * (1-p)
m
v
1-pnorm(15,m,sd=sqrt(v)/sqrt(100))
```

QUESTION: Two genesâ€™ expression values follow a bivariate normal distribution. Let X and Y 
denote their expression values respectively. Also, assume that X has mean=9 and 
variance=3.Y has mean=10 and variance=5. The covariance between X and Y is 2.  
 
In a trial, 50 independent measurements of the expression values of the two genes 
are collected, and denoted as , ...,  . We wish to find the 
probability , i.e., the probability that the sample mean for the 
second gene exceeds the sample mean of the first gene more than 0.5.  
 
Conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to approximate this probability, providing a 
95% confidence interval for your estimation. Submit your R script for the Monte 
Carlo simulation, and a brief summary of the actual simulation results. 

```{r}
library(MASS)
require(mvtnorm)

sigma = matrix(c(3, 2, 2, 5), nrow = 2)
mu = c(9, 10)

success = logical()
for(i in 1:10000){
  x = mvrnorm(50, mu, sigma)
  xbar = mean(x[,1])
  ybar = mean(x[,2])
  success[i] = xbar+.5<ybar
}
mean(success)
phat = mean(success)
se = sqrt(phat*(1-phat)/10000)
phat + c(-1,1)*qnorm(.975)*se
prop.test(sum(success), length(success))

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

QUESTION: Assume there are three independent random variables ~ , ~ 
, ~ t-distribution with degrees of freedom m=3.  
Define a new random variable Y as  (note that the square 
root is only for X1.)  
 
Use Monte Carlo simulation to find the mean of Y. Submit your R script for the 
Monte Carlo simulation, and summary of the actual simulation results. 

```{r}
n = 1000 # Generate 1000 test values 
X1 = rchisq(n,10)
X2 = rgamma(n,shape = 1, rate = 2)
X3 = rt(n,3)
Y = sqrt((X1*X2)+(4*(X3^2)))
mean(Y)

```

Running the Monte Carlo simulation 10 times produced average mean values between 3.2 and 3.3 for Y. 

QUESTION: Complete exercise 10 in Chapter 3 of Applied Statistics for Bioinformatics using R 
(page 45-46). Submit the plot, and a brief explanation of your observation. 
The problem refers to the density function of extreme value distribution in another  
book. You do not have to look for the other book, the density function is  
 
                f(x)=exp(-x)exp(-exp(-x)) 
 
Here exp(-x) is the same as e-x.

```{r}
set.seed(35646)
N <- 1000
n <- 1000
maxX <- c()

for(i in 1:N){
    maxX[i] <- max(rnorm(n))
}

an <- sqrt(2*log(n)) - 0.5*(log(log(n))+log(4*pi))*(2*log(n))^(-1/2)
bn <- (2*log(n))^(-1/2)

norm_maxX <- (maxX - an)/bn
# plot(1:1)
dev.new()

hist(norm_maxX, prob=TRUE,main= "Probability Distribution", ylim=c(0,0.4), col = "green", xlab="x", ylab = "Density")

curve(exp(-x)*exp(-exp(-x)), col = "blue", add=TRUE)
curve(dnorm(x), col = "red", add=TRUE)
```
